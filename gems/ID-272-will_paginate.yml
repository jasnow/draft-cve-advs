title: Security vulnerability when generating pagination URLs in Rails
date: 2016-10-18
description: |
  Before will_paginate 3.0.8 and 3.1.2, someone could add
  maliciously crafted content in script_name GET parameter,
  such as "&script_name=https://www.example.com," to a page
  with will_paginate links and it would could cause pagination
  links to get output pointing to another site, such as
  https://www.example.com, or even XSS.

  Release 3.0.8, 3.0.8, 3.1.1, and 3.1.2 were all
  released on 9/20/2016 with these titles:
  * Ignore original_script_name query parameter in generated URLs
  * Further fix security vulnerability when generating pagination URLs in Rails.
